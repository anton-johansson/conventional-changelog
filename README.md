# Conventional changelog

Generates changelogs from Git metadata.


## Usage

This library can be used in two different ways. The first one - and probably the most useful one - takes the form of a Maven plugin. The other one is a regular Java library that can be used to directly use the changelog API. This artifact is used by the Maven plugin.

### Maven plugin

See [documentation](./conventional-changelog-maven-plugin).

### Java library

See [documentation](./conventional-changelog-core).


## Inspiration

This library is deeply inspired by [conventional-changelog](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog) package for NodeJS.
